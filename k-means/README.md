<strong>
Clustering is a type of Unsupervised learning.
</strong>  This is very often used when you donâ€™t have labeled data. K-Means Clustering is one of the popular clustering algorithm.<strong> The goal of this algorithm is to find groups(clusters) in the given data</strong>. In this post we will implement K-Means algorithm using Python from scratch.
